diffpy.Structure - simple storage and manipulation of crystal structures

The diffpy.Structure package provides simple crystal structure operation
such as calculations of distances or angles from fractional coordinates.
It also provides imports and exports in several structure file formats
and space group definitions and utilities for symmetry expansion and 
generation of symmetry constraints on positions and thermal factors.

To learn more about diffpy.Structure library, see the examples directory
included in this distribution or the API documentation
