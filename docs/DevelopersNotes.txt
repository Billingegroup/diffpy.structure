* Other Structure Packages *

Chris investigated pymmLib, and decided that it overemphasizes molecules and is
therefore too complex for our purposes. It also appears that the software is
developing very slowly. Very few of the support requests on the project page
have been answered.

The space group code from pymmLib was useful, however, and merged into the
Structure package. For the time being, there is no need to use cctbx.

* Cif read/write *

The package PyCifRW can be used for cif file reading. OpenBabel was
investigated, and it does not support cif. OpenBabel deals only with molecular
structure formats, such as pdb.
